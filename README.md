# E Ink Weather display

Collection of code that uses the raspberry pi zero 2W with raspberyy pi OS, and the 2.13inch E-Ink Display HAT from Waveshare to display the minimum and maximum temperature in Melbourne, from the Bureau of Meteorology.


## Dependencies
To load fonts, I used this library. Just add the stb_truetype.h header in the /include folder.
